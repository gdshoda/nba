# NBA Data Pipeline

I am trying to build an NBA data pipeline that will maintain nba box score, play by play, and shot charting data in a Postgres database. The pipeline will then extend to capture injury data provided hourly by teams, as well as query the-odds-api to see changes in betting line movement.

My goal is to have a functioning NBA database that can be used to study trends in nba games, as well as trends in the betting odds based on player injuries, as well as in game actions.
